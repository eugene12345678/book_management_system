## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the **Book Management System** locally:

### Prerequisites:
- PHP >= 7.4
- MySQL (or MariaDB) database server
- A local server environment such as **XAMPP** or **MAMP**

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eugene12345678/book_management_system
   cd book-management-system
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   - Create a new database (e.g., `bookdatabase`) in your MySQL server.

   - Import the database structure (tables and initial data) by running the provided bookdatabase.sql file. You can find it in the `/book_management_system` directory of this project.

   Example of importing the SQL file:

   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/bookdatabase.sql;
   ```
3. **Configure the database connection:**

   - Open `includes/connection.php` and update the database credentials as per your local setup.

   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $username = 'root';  // Your MySQL username
   $password = '';      // Your MySQL password
   $dbname = 'bookdatabase'; // The name of the database
   ```
4. **Start your local server:**

   - Start Apache and MySQL via XAMPP or MAMP, or use the built-in PHP server:

   ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
   ```

   - Alternatively, you can run Apache and MySQL locally using ``systemctl`` on Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```
   - Once Apache and MySQL are running, visit ``http://localhost:8000`` in your browser to access the application.


   **Explanation:**
   - The additional `systemctl` commands will allow users to start Apache and MySQL services on Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali linux).


## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the following features:

1. **Login/Register:**
   - Create a new account or log in to your existing account.
   - Admin users can log in using the following credentials:
     - **Admin Login (username: admin, password: admin)**
     - **Root Admin Login (username: root, password: root)**

2. **Browse Books:**

   - Each book displays its title, description, price, and availability.

3. **Add to Cart:**

4. **Order and Checkout:**
   - After adding items to the cart, users can place an order and complete the checkout process.

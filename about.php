        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="text-justify container">
            Welcome to our online bookstore! I’m <strong>Eugene Mathenge</strong>, the founder and lead developer of this platform. What began as a simple love for books has evolved into a full-fledged digital haven for readers. This site was created to connect book lovers with great stories, inspiring authors, and a vibrant community.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <p class="text-justify container">
            The idea for this project was born in 2023, right here in <strong>Nairobi, Kenya</strong>. I wanted to make books more accessible through technology and create a platform that could bring people together through the power of storytelling. With hard work and a love for literature, this system was developed to serve both readers and administrators.
